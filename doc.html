          <!-- <h4 class="section__title">What is simC?</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Often people have trouble programming in C (especially beginners) due to its low level syntax and
              unavailability of stable third party libraries. We present sim-C a high-level front end for C
              which creates a dynamically typed syntax for C. User can write code in this high level syntax and
              then compile it to optimized C code. sim-C does not process the code and simply translates it to
              C thus, there is no possibility of the code running slowly. So, with sim-C users can write code
              faster using the high level syntax and at the same time be able to harness the power and speed of a
              C program. Let us make C cool again.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                pygeneses can be used for researching the various possible behaviours and trends by the artificial agents. The artificial conditions programmatically provided to study their behaviour show the results which can parallelly be compared to those of the real world conditions as the provided conditions are kept as close as possible in accordance with that of the natural laws.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">pygeneses is a tool to simulate a very primitive life. It can be used to train, study and analyse a complex artificial species as well but with more parameters and a more complex structure for the training model.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">pygeneses has been equipped with features to analyse the step by step behavior of the agent which is under observation while it gets trained in the model. This helps in understanding the reasons behind the agent’s particular behavior in the given circumstances and conditions.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">pygeneses can always be modified and updated to accumulate the new conditions and circumstances which could then be included and then the agent’s behaviors could be observed under those conditions as well along with the old conditions to analyse the behavior changes.

          <h3 class="section__title">About Packages</h3>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">As of version 0.1.3, the architecture of pygeneses is built around 4 major modules. Each of these modules provides a unique feature or functionality to the framework. So let’s get started with a brief introduction to each of them.</p>

          <ol>

            <li>
              <h4 class="section__title">envs</h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This module allows you to create, configure and tweak the in-built bio-inspired environments. As of now, this only provides a single environment called Prima-Vita (First Life), but there’s more coming soon! This lets you set up the entire environment our species requires in just a few lines of code and provides low level control over the environment.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="section__title">models</h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘models’ module is what allows us to import the neural networks which the species uses to learn what to do. As of now, only the default model implementation is provided, but we will be adding support for custom pluggable networks from v0.2 onwards.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="section__title">hypertune</h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘HyperTune’ package allows us to configure and test out various hyperparameters we can provide for an environment and species. This contains single-hyperparameterized testing, grid search and random search. This allows us to find the best set of hyperparameters to display a type of behavior. This also produces logs which we can study using Vitaboard.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="section__title">vitaboard</h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Vitaboard provides an advanced,interactive web-app to study agents during the training phase. After each agent dies, his actions are written into a log file. And vitaboard allows us to visualize the agents life. It provides us with a life visualizer, group statistics and a genetic history visualizer. It allows us to identify and understand behaviours exhibited by an agent while interacting with the environment or with other agents in the environment.
              </p>
            </li>

          </ol>
            
        </section>

        <section class="js-section">

          <h3 class="section__title">Examples</h3>
          
          <ol>

            <li>

              <h4 class="section__title">Basic Mode Training</h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">With PyGeneses installed, let’s write some code to train the PrimaVita agents.</p>

              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

                <li>

                  <h5 class="section__title">Example 1</h5>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Default Hyperparameter setting and REINFORCE algorithm</p>
                  <pre class="code code--block">
                    <code>
                        from pygeneses.envs.prima_vita import PrimaVita
                        rl_model = PrimaVita()
                        rl_model.run()
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">The three steps to train agents are:-</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Import PrimaVita (First life) class from envs.prima_vita</li>
                    <li>Instantiate the PrimaVita class</li>
                    <li>Call the run( ) method on the PrimaVita object</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">The above default setting will allow you to train the agents in ‘bot’ mode which means you will not be able to see the environment while training. In case, you want to see the environment throughout the training you just need to change the mode to ‘human’. The snippet belows shows the code for 'human' mode.</p>
                  <pre class="code code--block">
                    <code>
                        from pygeneses.envs.prima_vita import PrimaVita
                        rl_model = PrimaVita(mode="human")
                        rl_model.run()
                    </code>
                  </pre>

                </li>

                <li>

                  <h5 class="section__title">Example 2</h5>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Changing the default hyper parameters</p>

                  <pre class="code code--block">
                    <code>
                      from pygeneses.envs.prima_vita import PrimaVita
                      params_dic = {"initial_energy": 300, "model_updates": 25}
                      rl_model = PrimaVita(params_dic=params_dic)
                      rl_model.run()
                    </code>
                  </pre>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">You just have to pass a dictionary with keys as the name of the hyperparameter (here the initial energy of agents and the time in ticks after which model will be updated are changed) and the values as the value you want to specify. For a more detailed list of available hyperparameters refer to the official docs.</p>

                </li>

              </ol>
              
            </li>

            <li>

              <h4 class="section__title">Hypertune</h4>

              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

                <li>

                  <h5 class="section__title">Grid Search</h5>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">This takes in a pool of hyperparameter values as input and trains the model with all the possible combinations of these values. This is useful when you want to try out different values of a hyperparameter or group of hyperparameters.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Following is a snippet of code for applying a grid search over pool of hyperparameters using hypertune:-</p>
                  <pre class="code code--block">
                    <code>
                      from pygeneses.hypertune import HyperTune

                      tuner = HyperTune(model_class='PrimaVita',
                      hyperparameters=['initial_energy', 'max_age', 'kill_type'],
                      values=[[100,200], [10, 50, 90], ['difference', 'random']],
                      stop_at=2000)

                      tuner.hypertuner()
                    </code>
                  </pre>

                </li>

                <li>

                  <h5 class="section__title">Randomized Search</h5>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">This takes in a pool of hyperparameter values as input and but unlike Grid Search, it trains the model only on a handful of combinations which is a subset of all possible combinations and the combinations in this subset is chosen randomly based on a probability</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Following is a snippet of code for applying a randomised search over a pool of hyperparameters using hypertune:-</p>
                  <pre class="code code--block">
                    <code>
                      from pygeneses.hypertune import HyperTune

State is what the agent perceives in its environment (state in our environment is distance vectors to food particles and other agents followed by current energy of an agent, it tells the agent how close it is to another agent or food particle and what is its current energy). The padding length will be 1 less than what is mentioned so as to accomodate the single value - energy. So, the default value of 21 will pad the vectors to 20 length after which energy is appended.</td>

Note:- the values allowed for this hyperparameter are the strings - "difference" and "random" only.</td>
